            <h2>What are Geographical Indicators?</h2>
            <p>
                A geographical indication (GI) is a sign used on products that have a specific geographical origin
                and possess qualities or a reputation that are due to that origin. In order to function as a GI, a sign
                must identify a product as originating in a given place.
            </p>

            <h2>Why are they important?</h2>
